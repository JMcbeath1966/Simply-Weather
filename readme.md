## Project Overview ðŸ”¥

This project is an interactive site providing the weather for cities and information on other weather/climate related sites, to make it more than just a weather application. The site will be interactive, using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript(ES6) to code the site.

The website site is designed to be accessed and responsive to make it simple for players to access weather details and, using clear click-on links, find out about weather related topics such as climate change and other world weather information services.

## User Experience ðŸ”¥

- Visit goals

  - Prominent search function to enter city at the earliest opportunity
  - Visually access a range of key weather details for the users chosen city location.
  - Navigate intuitively through the site to find key information about the weather related topics
  - Provide key information to encourage the user to look at the recommended sites
  - Easy access to the recommended sites.

  ## Design ðŸ”¥

* Color Scheme

  - White will be the only color used for text and icons. Default color will be the only exception as this will use the default color.

* Typography

  - The font-family is: font-family: 'Golos Text', sans-serif which has clean, modern style.

* Imagery Design

  - The imagery is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention, but not distract too much from the content, hence a subtle linear gradient has been applied

## Testing ðŸ”¥

## HTML, CSS and SEO Testing ðŸ”¥

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

- W3C Markup Validator - Saved Result Files and Resolutions -[Here](https://github.com/JMcbeath1966/Simply-Weather/blob/main/validation/w3c-html-results.png)
  - Duplicate class error resolved easily by removing duplicates within the class element
  - H3 error as it was within a table. H3 moved to the line above the start of the table tag to resolve the issue
- W3C CSS Validator - Saved Result Files and Resolutions - [Here](https://github.com/JMcbeath1966/Simply-Weather/blob/main/validation/w3c-css-results.png)
  - Missing semi colon from a linear gradient media query. Semi colon added to resolve issue
- Lighthouse SEO - Saved Result Files and Resolutions - [Here](https://github.com/JMcbeath1966/Simply-Weather/blob/main/validation/seo-lighthouse-sw.png)
  - Accessability, performance and best practice all 91% and above.

## Further Testing ðŸ”¥

- Predominantly female friends & family (4 girls and their friends) were used to test the website and to provide user experience feedback. My son who is also learning to code also provided feedback on the website.
- The website was tested on Mozilla, Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer browsers
- Testing was carried out thoroughly on external/internal links to ensure they all opened to a new tab.
- The website was viewed on a variety of mobiles, laptop and desktops.
- My mentor also provided valued feedback on the project.

### Visitor Goals ðŸ”¥

1. As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and find the weather easily
2. Sign up through a modal (popup) and receive an email confirming the user details and a thank you message.
3. Visually access all key weather details for the users chosen city location.
4. Navigate intuitively through the site to find key information
5. Provide key information to encourage the user to look at the recommended sites
6. Easy access to the recommended sites.

## Deployment ðŸ”¥

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
   - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
